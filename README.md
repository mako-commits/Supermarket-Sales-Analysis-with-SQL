Thousands of people visit supermarkets every day to buy food and housing supplies. By analyzing this data,
we can learn more about customer preferences regarding payment methods, visiting times, and membership in 
loyalty programs â€” based on location or gender. Then, we can adjust every single supermarket to increase customer 
satisfaction and profits.

This dataset contains data about selling points and the customers of three branches of a supermarket company collected over three months.
By analyzing this dataset, we can answer these questions:

Which branch has the best results in the loyalty program?
Does the membership depend on customer rating?
Does gross income depend on the proportion of customers in the loyalty program? On payment method?
Are there any differences in indicators between men and women?
Which product category generates the highest income?
